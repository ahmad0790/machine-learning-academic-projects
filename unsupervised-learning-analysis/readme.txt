1) To run the jupyter notebooks please install conda and create a new environment

2) Then install the files in the requirements.txt file. Some of these are not needed for the assignment but the key libraries that you should install install are Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Numpy, Jupyter without which the code will not run.

3) Please make sure the datasets are in the same folder. All datasets used are already downloaded in this folder.

4) Run the code through Jupyter.

The code is also available on my GitHub repo here:

I used some of the code from this personâ€™s Kaggle notebook to help generate the heat maps for my cluster although my dataset was still a bit different. I would like to assign credit to this person for the heat map code.
